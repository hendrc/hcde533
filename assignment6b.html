            The documentation below spans two projects:<br>
            Project 6 Part 2. Final molding and casting of my iron prow part for the Venetian gondola<br>
            Project 7 Part 1. Final project proposal<br><br>
 
            PROJECT 6 PART 2: At the start of my molding and casting project, I searched <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a> for inspiration from Italy and landed on this Ferro di prua (iron prow-head of a gondola, the most iconic boat that one can find in Venice). Given that my mother's side of the family all have Venetian roots, this ornament has sentimental value:<br><br>

            To have a physical model of a gondola and iron prow to use for further ideation, I 3D printed these STL files that I found online. I scaled the gondola down by 90% just to have a model that I could hold in one hand for reference, and I scaled down the iron prow as well so that I could get a sense for how I might need to modify the object in order to use it effectively to create a 3D printed mold:<br><br>

            <a href="a6-gondola-head.stl">Gondola iron prow STL file</a><br><br>

            I thought the unique shape of the iron prow would make an interesting molding and casting challenge. My plan was to keep it on the smaller side but to scale it up large (and wide) enough to mitigate breaking the object when later removing it from a mold in later steps. The iron prow head of the gondola is full of symbolism with each element of its design having historical and regional significance to the people of the Veneto region.<br><br>

            I brought the STL file I found online into Rhino and used it as a departure point to start designing my 3D mold. The original dimensions of the STL file were quite small, so I scaled up the design in 3D to approximately 8 cm in length. Because some elements of the model were delicate (for instance, the thinner, finger-looking elements pointing in the same direction). I also scaled the width of the entire model to approximately 1.6 cm to increase the volume to reduce risk of encountering issues when casting the part in plaster in later steps.<br><br>

            When reviewing my model with our fabulous TA, Junchao, he recommended that I consider reinforcing it by increasing the thickness in some of the more delicate areas of the design to mitigate those from collapsing or breaking. With his brilliant design enhancements incorporated, the reinforced model maintained the model's sleek, original geometry, yet it became much more 3D printing, molding, and casting-friendly!<br><br>

            As next steps, I'll head to the university makerspace to 3D print my mold, then use the mold to cast silicone (OOMOO 30), and finally I'll use my silicone mold to cast 4 identical plaster parts. To be continued!<br><br>
