            This project entailed the design and fabrication of a 2-part (silicone) mold. As an outcome, the project required using the silicone mold to cast at least 4 identical parts, and for that last step I decided to cast my parts in hydrostone. I designed my master part in CAD (Rhino) first, then used it to design the 3D printable mold into which I poured the Oomoo 30, and lastly used the silicone mold to cast my hydrostone parts. Below I document the end-to-end process from ideation to final molding and casting of my model, the iconic iron prow of the Venetian gondola.<br><br>
 
            At the start of my molding and casting project, I searched <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a> for inspiration from Italy and landed on this Ferro di prua (iron prow-head of a gondola, the most iconic boat that one can find in Venice). Given that my mother's side of the family all have Venetian roots, this ornament has sentimental value:<br><br>

            To have a physical model of a gondola and iron prow to use for further ideation, I 3D printed these STL files that I found online. I scaled the gondola down by 90% just to have a model that I could hold in one hand for reference, and I scaled down the iron prow as well so that I could get a sense for how I might need to modify the object in order to use it effectively to create a 3D printed mold:<br><br>
