             For this project, my goal was to design a box made up of flat panels with fingerjoints. I 3D printed all of the box panels to design for an interference fit so that when the panels are pressed together, they join tightly and do not need additional fasteners or screws. 
             The challenge was to design a close enough fit that the resulting box could hold something like sugar without leaking.<br><br>   
                
             With direct support from our wonderful teaching assistant, Junchao, I learned how to create a box model using Rhino. I admittedly had some challenges with visualizing how to design the panels using a joining method, and Junchao modeled this initial design to show how to use dogbones:<br><br>

             While looking around for more inspiration, I noticed this old-fashinoned coffee box with finger joints in the display case of a local coffee shop, and I decided to use it as a jumping off point for my own model:<br><br>
