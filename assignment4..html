             For this project, my goal was to explore CNC milling. I set out to design a box with e.g. boxjoints/fingerjoints, tabs, or another joining method that could be milled out of FR1 on the Othermill.
             With direct support from our wonderful teaching assistant, Junchao, I learned how to create these shapes in Rhino that I would later cut on the Othermill.<br><br>
            
             Here is the Rhino model that I initially started with:<br><br>

             <img src="a4-rhino-cnc-mill-artistic.jpg" width=300></a><br><br>
             <a href="a2-laser-shape1.3dm">Rhino 7 file (my learning in progress!)</a><br><br>
             
             After finishing the tutorial, I documented a couple more shots of my final Grasshopper definition and Rhino model:<br><br>

             <img src="a4-rhino-cnc-mill-artistic.jpg" width=300></a><br><br>

             I went to the makerspace to laser cut and... to be continued!
