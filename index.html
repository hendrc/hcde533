            Ciao, tutti! My name is Courtenay. This is my final year of the HCDE Master's program. I'm taking digital fabrication to enjoy some hands-on engineering in a studio environment, a new experience for me. I'm looking forward to learning all about 3D printing, laser cutting, modeling, molding, and casting, and working with a variety of new technology. With regard to peer support, I'm a project manager by trade, and I would be happy to offer consultation in this area if needed!

		This was my first experience using CAD software. I created a Rhino model of a rectangular object to be laser cut on cardboard 30 times and press fit into a shape that could withstand "light shaking". To build some familiarity with using Rhino functionality, I kept it simple!
