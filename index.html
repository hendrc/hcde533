            Hello, all! My name is Courtenay. In my last year of the HCDE Master's program, I'm taking digital fabrication to enjoy some hands-on engineering in a studio environment, a new experience for me. I'm looking forward to learning all about 3D printing, laser cutting, modeling, molding, and casting, and working with a variety of new technology.<br><br>
	    I'm a project manager by trade with management consulting experience spanning UX research, digital marketing, language services, and localization. I speak English and French, and I understand Spanish and Italian. I'd be happy to answer questions/provide peer support in any of these domains!<br>
            </p>

                  <img src="laser-press-fit-a.jpg" width=250></a><br>
		This was my first experience using CAD software. My goals were to design a Rhino model of an object to be laser cut 30 times on cardboard and then press fit into a shape that could withstand "light shaking".<br>

                  <img src="grasshopper-modeling.png" width=250></a><br>
		Here I created a parametric model using a Grasshopper definition, exported to Rhino and baked the shape, then laser cut on cardboard and clipped together a new form.<br>
