            Hello, all! My name is Courtenay. In my last year of the HCDE Master's program, I'm taking digital fabrication to enjoy some hands-on engineering in a studio environment, a new experience for me. I'm looking forward to learning all about 3D printing, laser cutting, modeling, molding, and casting, and working with a variety of new technology.<br><br>
	    I'm a project manager by trade with management consulting experience spanning UX research, digital marketing, language services, and localization. I speak English and French, and I understand Spanish and Italian. I'd be happy to answer questions/provide peer support in any of these domains!<br>

              <a href="assignment1.html"><h2>Assignment 1: Modeling and Laser Cutting</h2>
                  <img src="laser-press-fit-a.jpg" width=250></a><br>
		This was my first experience using CAD software. My goals were to design a Rhino model of an object to be laser cut 30 times on cardboard and then press fit into a shape that could withstand "light shaking".<br>

                  <img src="gh-laser-final-form.jpg" width=250></a><br>
		Here I created a parametric model using a Grasshopper definition, exported to Rhino and baked the shape, then laser cut on cardboard and clipped together a new form.<br>

              <a href="assignment3.html"><h2>Assignment 3: Getting Started with 3D Printing</h2>
                  <img src="a3-cube1-lowquality.jpg" width=250></a><br>
		For this project I assembled a 3D printer, then ran a set of test prints on different shapes of varying configurations to build familiarity with the printing process, including slicer software settings, calibration, and technique.<br>

              <a href="assignment4.html"><h2>Assignment 4: Subtractive Manufacturing</h2>
                  <img src="a4-iteration2-box-pieces-print1.jpg" width=250></a><br>
		This project involved further exploration into 3D printing. I set out to design a box with some kind of joining method such as fingerjoints/boxjoints, tabs, etc., that could be assembled with a gap-free, tight fit.<br>

                  <img src="a4-iteration2-box-pieces-print1.jpg" width=250></a><br>
		  Here I embark on a journey to learn about and experiment with meshes, and then using various digital fabrication techniques, use those learnings to create a lamp!<br>
