            Concept:<br>
 
            Being an amateur barista and all-around coffee connoisseur, last year I bought myself a De'Longhi combination coffee and espresso maker. What I'd been missing, however, was a convenient way to remove and collect my coffee grounds... until now! <br><br>

            Espresso knock box components:<br>
            <ul><li>Knock box (made of PLA)</li>
            <li>Knock bar (steel rod covered in food-safe rubber exterior)</li>
            <li>Sticky "feet' (to adhere to the bottom exterior of the knockbox and keep it from moving when in use)</li>
            <li>A molded and casted food-safe silicone part (to place at the bottom interior of the knock box and absorb heat from hot coffee grounds)</li></ul><br>

            Use case:<br>
            The knock box is a super practical kitchen tool that simplifies the art of coffeemaking and makes it more environmentally friendly by incorporating a way to easily compost our coffee grounds. On the retail market, a knock box can cost anywhere from $15 to $100 depdening on the brand, quality, and grade of materials used to produce it. For comparison, the materials for my DIY knock box cost less than $15, and I'm very happy with the quality and finish! This new tool also makes it easier to remove espresso grounds from the portafilter, saving me from knocking the grounds into the garbage can (so wasteful!) By collecting my coffee grounds in the new knock box, I've started a new "tiny habit" of composting them and <a href="https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/composting/ingredients/coffee-grounds-gardening.htm">can use the compost to enrich my garden soil</a>. In addition, coffee grounds can be an effective, environmentally-friendly fertiizer for certain plants and flowers, and they can serve as a helpful natural pesticide to mitigate garden slugs and snails!<br><br>
              
            Process:<br?
            I kicked off my ideation process by searching <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a> for knock boxes that others have successfully made and reviewed. This particular design was a helpful departure point for kicking off some sketching:<br><br>
            <img src="a7-espresso-knock-box-inspo2.png" width=300></a><br><br>

            I wanted to document a few different ideas for how I could design the parts of the knock box so that I could have some flexibility and design options to pivot in a different direction in the event that I run into any scheduling conflicts and/or cannot secure the desired  materials I'm hoping to use for fabrication:<br><br>
            <img src="a7-sketching.jpg" width=300></a><br><br>

            After landing on the preliminary design idea, I started creating my high level project plan. Below is the list of digital fabrication techniques that I planned to use for my final project - and a note about which ones I ended up using for the final product:<br>
            1. Rhino - planned and imcorporated<br>
            2. Grasshopper - planned but NOT incorporated<br>
            3. 3D printing - planned and incorporated (using 3 different printers during prototyping!)<br>
            4. Interface fits/intersecting parts (i.e., interface between the knock box and the knock bar) - planned and incorporated<br>
            5. Stretch goal: Molding and casting the "grippy" part on the bottom of the box in silicone<br><br> - planned and incorporated<br><br>

            Contingency incorporated into final design during the testing phase - purchased a stock part for the knock bar - this pivot to a stock part was part of my project proposal. In this case, I purchased a knock bar with a steel center and rubber exterior to increase the overall strength of the design given that a significant force can be exerted on the knock bar when someone tries to remove coffee grounds from the portafilter!<br><br> 

            Here is a breakdown of tasks and a proposed timeline for completing my project:<br>
            1. November 23-30: Ideation/modeling in CAD and sourcing of materials (contingency: pending feedback on TPU, might use PLA or buy a stock part for the knock bar and connectors)<br>
            2. November 28-30: Refinement of CAD models in Rhino and Grasshopper (contingency: if Grasshopper modeling of grippy part for box bottom isn't successful, will buy stock "grippy" parts and adhere with glue<br>
            3. December 1-3: 3D printing and testing intersecting parts<br>
            4. December 2-3: (Stretch goal) Molding and casting the "grippy" part in silicone<br> 
            5. December 4-5: Assembling and testing (knocking!) the final espresso knock box<br>
            5. December 5: It's my birthday, yay! To celebrate, I'll document my final project on GitHub!<br><br>

            Below is my expected bill of materials:<br>
            1. CAD software (Rhino/Grasshopper) - secured<br> 
            2. PLA filament (already own) - secured<br>
            3. Oomoo (already own but using silicone for molding and casting is contingent on successful Grasshopper modeling/testing) - secured<br>
            4. Portafilter for "knock" testing - secured<br>
            5. Thermoplastic Polyurethane aka TPU (pending feasibility of using this material for the knock bar) -need to purchase<br>
            5. "Grippy" pads for bottom of knock box (need to source material as outlined in timeline, then make a purchase decision as part of contingency plan).<br><br>
