            <h1>Final Project Proposal: An Espresso Knock Box</h1>

            Concept:<br>
 
            Being an amateur barista and all-around coffee connoisseur, last year I bought myself this De'Longhi combination coffee and espresso maker for my birthday - all the caffeine I ever wanted!<br><br>
            <img src="a7-delonghi.jpg" width=300></a><br><br>

            Use case:<br>
            Thinking about my final project, I thought it would be exciting to use digital fabrication techniques to make a new kitchen tool that I could incorporate into my daily coffee routine, something practical that would make the art of coffeemaking even more enjoyable, efficient, and as a stretch goal, maybe more environmentally friendly! I thought perhaps I could create an espresso knock box to sit on kitchen counter next to my espresso maker - this way I could more easily remove the espresso grounds from the portafilter, saving me from knocking my coffee grounds into the garbage can (so wasteful!) Moreover, by collecting my coffee grounds in a knock box, I could start a new "tiny habit" of composting them and <a href="https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/composting/ingredients/coffee-grounds-gardening.htm">use the compost to enrich my garden soil</a>. In addition, coffee grounds can be an effective, environmentally-friendly fertiizer for certain plants and flowers, and they can serve as a helpful natural pesticide to mitigate garden slugs and snails!<br><br>
              
            To fuel my imagination, I searched <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a> to look for coffee-related kitchen tools that others have successfully made and reviewed. I found this 3D printable knock box as a great departure point for kicking off further ideation:<br><br>

            As a next step, I made an Americano and took a seat at my ktichen bar to do some sketching. I wanted to document a few different ideas for how I could design the parts of the knock box so that I could have some flexibility and design options to pivot in a different direction in the event that I run into any scheduling conflicts and/or cannot secure the desired  materials I'm hoping to use for fabrication:<br><br>

            Here is the a list of the digital fabrication techniques I plan to use for my final project:<br>
            1. Rhino<br>
            2. Grasshopper<br>
            3. 3D printing<br>
            4. Interface fits/intersecting parts (i.e., interface between the knock box and the knock bar)<br>
            5. Stretch goal: Molding and casting the "grippy" part on the bottom of the box in silicone<br><br>

            Here is a breakdown of tasks and a proposed timeline for completing my project:<br>
            1. November 23-30: Ideation/modeling in CAD and sourcing of materials (contingency: pending feedback on TPU, might use PLA or buy a stock part for the knock bar and connectors)<br>
            2. November 28-30: Refinement of CAD models in Rhino and Grasshopper (contingency: if Grasshopper modeling of grippy part for box bottom isn't successful, will buy stock "grippy" parts and adhere with glue<br>
            3. December 1-3: 3D printing and testing intersecting parts<br>
            4. December 2-3: (Stretch goal) Molding and casting the "grippy" part in silicone<br> 
            5. December 4-5: Assembling and testing (knocking!) the final espresso knock box<br>
            5. December 5: It's my birthday, yay! To celebrate, I'll document my final project on GitHub!<br><br>

            Below is my expected bill of materials:<br>
            1. CAD software (Rhino/Grasshopper) - secured<br> 
            2. PLA filament (already own) - secured<br>
            3. Oomoo (already own but using silicone for molding and casting is contingent on successful Grasshopper modeling/testing) - secured<br>
            4. Portafilter for "knock" testing - secured<br>
            5. Thermoplastic Polyurethane aka TPU (pending feasibility of using this material for the knock bar) -need to purchase<br>
            5. "Grippy" pads for bottom of knock box (need to source material as outlined in timeline, then make a purchase decision as part of contingency plan).<br><br>
