            Concept:<br>
 
            Being an amateur barista and all-around coffee connoisseur, last year I bought myself a De'Longhi combination coffee and espresso maker. What I'd been missing, however, was a convenient way to remove and collect my coffee grounds... until now! <br><br>
            <img src="a8-concept.jpg" width=300></a><br><br>

            Espresso knock box components:<br>
            <ul><li>A knock box (black PLA)</li>
            <li>A knock bar (stock part - steel rod covered in food-safe rubber exterior)</li>
            <li>4 sticky "feet' (stock part - clear rubber "feet" adhered to bottom exterior of the knockbox to keep it from moving when in use)</li>
            <li>A molded and casted food-safe, gold-colored silicone part (placed at bottom interior of the knock box to absorb heat from hot coffee grounds)</li></ul><br>

            Use case:<br>
            The knock box is a super practical kitchen tool that simplifies the art of coffeemaking and makes it more environmentally friendly by incorporating a way to easily compost our coffee grounds. On the retail market, a knock box can cost anywhere from $15 to $100 depending on the brand, quality, and grade of materials used to produce it. For comparison, the materials for my DIY knock box cost less than $15 to make, and I'm very happy with the quality and finish!<br><br>

            This new tool also makes it easier to remove espresso grounds from the portafilter, saving me from knocking the grounds into the garbage can (so wasteful!) Collecting my coffee grounds in the new knock box made it easy to start a new "tiny habit" of composting them and <a href="https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/composting/ingredients/coffee-grounds-gardening.htm">using them as compost to enrich my garden soil</a>. In addition, coffee grounds can be an effective, environmentally-friendly fertiizer for certain plants and flowers, and they can serve as a helpful natural pesticide to mitigate garden slugs and snails!<br><br>
              
            Process:<br>
            I kicked off my ideation process by searching <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a> for knock boxes that others have successfully made and reviewed. These particular designs were helpful departure points for kicking off some sketching at different points in my ideation:<br>

            <img src="a8-knockbox-inspo3.png" width=300></a><br><br>

            I also did some field research exploring different brands of knock boxes in the retail market. I wanted to touch different materials used to produce them and evaluate the interface between different knock boxes and knock bars to help inform my own design choices.<br><br>

            I sketched some ideas for how I could design various components of the knock box leaving some flexibility to pivot in a different direction in the event that I would run into any scheduling conflicts and/or could not secure the desired  materials I was hoping to use for fabrication:<br><br>

            <img src="a8-sketching.jpg" width=300></a><br><br>

            After landing on the design I wanted to move forward with, I created my high level project plan with a couple of contingencies built in just in case. Below is the list of digital fabrication techniques that I planned to use for my final project, highhlighting which ones I ended up incorporating into the final design and which ones I did not opt to incorporate:<br>
            1. Rhino - planned and imcorporated<br>
            2. Grasshopper - planned but NOT incorporated<br>
            3. 3D printing - planned and incorporated (using 3 different printers during prototyping!)<br>
            4. Interface fits/intersecting parts (i.e., interface between the knock box and the knock bar) - planned and incorporated<br>
            5. Stretch goal: Molding and casting the "grippy" part on the bottom of the box in silicone<br><br> - planned and incorporated<br><br>

            Contingency incorporated into final design during the testing phase - purchased a stock part for the knock bar - this pivot to a stock part was part of my project proposal. In this case, I purchased a knock bar with a steel center and rubber exterior to increase the overall strength of the design given that a significant force can be exerted on the knock bar when someone tries to remove coffee grounds from the portafilter!<br><br> 

            Breakdown of tasks and timeline for completing my project:<br>
            1. November 23-30: Ideation/modeling in CAD and sourcing of materials (as a contingency on using TPU to print the knock bar, my backup plan was to either use PLA or buy a stock part for the knock bar - I decided to go with the stock part)<br>
            2. November 28-30: Refinement of CAD models in Rhino and Grasshopper (as a contingency for using Grasshopper to model a grippy part to adhere to the bottom exterior of the knock box, my backup plan was to buy stock "grippy" parts and adhere with glue - I opted not to use Grasshopper for this to save time, and I bought the stock part instead - 4 rubber feet which adhered nicely to the knock box and keep it from moving when knocked)<br>
            3. December 1-3: 3D printing and testing intersecting parts<br> (this took multiple iterations - I printed 2 prototypes before finalizing my design, and printed the final design in my third printing iteration). 
            4. December 2-3: (Stretch goal) Molding and casting the "grippy" part in silicone<br> (I completed a stretch goal of using molding and casting as one of my fabrication techniques - the food-safe silicone part placed in the bottom interior of the knock box to serve as a landing point for hot coffee grounds)
            5. December 4-5: Assembling and testing (knocking!) the final espresso knock box<br> (see video below!)
            5. December 5: Documentation of my final project on GitHub!<br><br> (this took one extra day than planned!)

            Final bill of materials:<br>
            1. CAD software (Rhino/Grasshopper) - secured<br> 
            2. PLA filament (already own) - secured<br>
            3. Oomoo (already own but using silicone for molding and casting is contingent on successful Grasshopper modeling/testing) - secured<br>
            4. Portafilter for "knock" testing - secured<br>
            5. Thermoplastic Polyurethane aka TPU (pending feasibility of using this material for the knock bar) -need to purchase<br>
            5. "Grippy" pads for bottom of knock box (need to source material as outlined in timeline, then make a purchase decision as part of contingency plan).<br><br>
