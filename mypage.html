            My name is Courtenay Hendricks! 
            <br>
            This is my third and final year of the Master's program. I'm taking digital fabrication to enjoy a hands-on engineering class in a studio environment, which will be a new experience for me. I'm looking forward to the challenge of learning all about 3D printing, laser cutting, modeling, molding, and casting, and working with a variety of new tools and technology. With regard to teaching my peers, the skills I can offer fall more into project management, and I would be happy to offer consultation in this area.
