            This project involves the following two parts:<br><br>
            Part 1: Mesh exploration: Modify the mesh of two STLs to produce a single printable STL. For online inspiration, start by visiting Thingiverse or a comparable site to look for examples of other peoples' creations, e.g., STLs and closed meshes, to play with for learning and experimentation purposes. Once I create a new mesh, before exporting the STL from Rhino, I need to confirm that it passed all checks for rapid prototyping.<br>
            Part 2: Lamp creation: Using measurements of the lamp innards that I purchased on Amazon.com as a point of departure, create a lamp that can be assembled around the innards using a variety a digital fabrication techniques.<br><br>

            As a first step, I looked outside to the natural world for color and texture inspiration and documented some ideas to consider incorporating into my overall design. On a walkabout in a local park in the Pacific Northwest of the U.S., I came across these vibrant fall colors and intriguing textures:<br><br>
