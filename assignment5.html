            This project involved 2 parts:<br><br>
            Part 1: Mesh exploration: I experimented with modifying the mesh of two STLs to produce a single, printable STL. For online inspiration, I started by visiting Makerbot Thingiverse to look for examples of other peoples' creations, e.g., STLs and interesting closed meshes. I found this "rocktupus" mesh (a hilarious idea inspired by "rock n roll" and "octupus") and imported the STL into Rhino 7.<br><br>
           
            Next, I took the original STL (a closed mesh to start with), scaled it down in 3D, then ran the reducemesh command, then quadremesh (my intention was to make it more low poly and smooth it out before duplicating it so that I would have two meshes to play with). Next, I duplicated the quadremeshed rocktupus and moved the two meshes next to each other, intersecting their tentacles as if they were holding hands.<br>br>

            In order to produce a single STL out of these two meshes, at first I thought I could

            Part 2: Lamp creation: Using measurements of the lamp innards that I purchased on Amazon.com as a point of departure, I set out to create a lamp that can be assembled around the lamp's innards using a variety a digital fabrication techniques.<br><br>

            As part of the ideation process, I looked outside to the natural world for color and texture inspiration and documented some ideas to consider incorporating into my overall design. On a walkabout in a local park in the Pacific Northwest of the U.S., I came across these vibrant fall colors and intriguing textures:<br><br>
