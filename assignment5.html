            This two-week project involves the following two parts: 
            Part 1: Modify the mesh of two STLs to produce a single printable STL. For online inspiration, start by visiting Thingiverse or a comparable site to look closed meshes that I could play with for experimentation purposes. Once I create a new mesh, before exporting the STL from Rhino, I need to confirm that it passed all checks for rapid prototyping.<br>
            Part 2: In part 2, I'll start making a lamp using the measurments from my lamp innereds' as a point of departure. My goal is to make a lamp that can be assembled around the innereds using a variety a digital fabrication techniques.<br><br>   
            
            As a first step, I looked outside in the natural world for inspiration on color and texture to consider for my overall design. On a visit to my local park, I came across these beutiful fall colors and textures on a walk:<br><br>
