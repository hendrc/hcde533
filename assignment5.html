            This project involved 2 parts:<br><br>
            Part 1: Mesh exploration: I experimented with modifying the mesh of two STLs to produce a single, printable STL. For online inspiration, I started by visiting the <a href="https://www.talkstorybookstore.com/">Makerbot Thingiverse</a> website to look for examples of other peoples' creations, e.g., STLs and interesting closed meshes. I found this "rocktupus" mesh (an hilarious concept seemingly inspired by rock n roll and the octupus!) I imported the STL into Rhino 7 and started exploring it.<br><br>
           
            Next, with the original STL (a closed mesh to start with), I scaled it down in 3D, ran the reducemesh command on it, then ran quadremesh (my intention was to make it more low poly and smooth it out before duplicating it so that I would have two meshes to play with). Next, I duplicated the quadremeshed rocktupus and horizontally aligned the two meshes next to each other, intersecting their tentacles as if they were naturally holding hands.<br><br>

            In order to produce a single STL out of these two meshes, at first I tried simply running the booleanunion command. However, I quickly realized that this may not be the correct command because I couldn't select either mesh in my Rhino viewport!<br><br>
            I asked my classmates for any troubleshooting tips they could offer, and one student (thanks JessieZ!) suggested trying the meshbooleanunion command instead. It worked! I was able to join the two meshes for further iteration on the rocktupus idea and export the new mesh as a single. printable STL.<br><br>

            Caveat: for part 2 of this project, I took a SHARP pivot away from the digital, meshy rocktupus and looked outside for inspiration while thinking about my lamp design!<br><br> 
            Part 2: Lamp creation: Using measurements of some lamp "innards" that I purchased on Amazon.com as a point of departure, I set out to create a lamp that could be assembled around the lamp's innards using a variety a digital fabrication techniques.<br><br>

             While looking out the window, I observed how the sunlight was shining through the leaves in this Japanese Maple. Such a pretty orange color!<br><br>

             I stepped outside to take a photo of the same tree from another angle and to forage some of its leaves for further discovery.<br><br>

             During my ideation process, I spent some more time in nature looking for further color and texture inspiration and documented some ideas to consider incorporating into my design. On a walkabout at a local park in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, I came across these vibrant fall colors and intriguing textures:<br><br>

            Then, I returned to the web and looked for some leafy lamp designs for further inspiration. I found this one and decided to explore it further:
