             For this project I set out to Once your 3D printer is assembled, create (in Rhino), slice (in Cura), and do some print testing of different models to build familiarity with the process. 
             I watched a tutorial given by my briliant professor Nadya on how to prepare various Rhino models for export to STL format, slice in Cura, and then feed to the 3D printer. With some support from the makerspace staff, I was able to print a cube at low quality measuring 2 cm in 13 minutes!<br><br>
            
             Here are some shots of the early stage of my Grasshopper definition work-in-progress:<br><br>

             <a href="a2-gh-model-wip.gh">Grasshopper file (a snaphoot in time!)</a><br>
             <a href="a2-laser-shape1.3dm">Rhino 7 file (my learning in progress!)</a><br><br>
             
             After finishing the tutorial, I documented a couple more shots of my final Grasshopper definition and Rhino model:<br><br>

             I went to the makerspace to laser cut my parametric shape and do some testing. Before cutting, I measured the depth of my cardboard, which measured 3.5 mm. Next, I had to convert my Rhino file (.3dm) to Adobe Illustrator (.ai), reduce the stroke weight to .01 pt, and change the color to RGB (255, 0, 0) so that the laser printer would recognize it.<br><br>
           
             When testing the fit of my first pair of laser cut parts, I found the clipping together to be a bit clunky. The laser power setting appeared to be set too low because the edges of the first two cardboard prototypes were a bit ragged.<br><br>
