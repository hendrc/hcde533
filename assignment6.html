            This project involved 2 parts:<br>
            Part 1: Final lamp<br>
            Part 2: Molding and casting<br><br>
           
            PART 1: (Lamp process) Using measurements of some lamp "innards" that I purchased on Amazon.com as a point of departure, I set out to create a lamp that could be assembled around the lamp's innards using a variety a digital fabrication techniques.<br><br>

             While looking out the window, I observed how the sunlight was shining through the leaves in this Japanese Maple. Such a pretty orange color!<br><br> 
             <img src="a5-inspiration6.jpg" width=300></a><br><br>
             I stepped outside to take a photo of the same tree from another angle and to forage some of its leaves for further discovery.<br><br>

             During my ideation process, I spent some more time in nature looking for further color and texture inspiration and documented some ideas to consider incorporating into my design. On a walkabout at a local park in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, I came across these vibrant fall colors and intriguing textures:<br><br>
             <img src="a5-inspiration2.jpg" width=300></a><br>
             <img src="a5-inspiration1.jpg" width=300></a><br>
             <img src="a5-inspiration5.jpg" width=300></a><br><br>

            Then, I returned to the web and looked for some leafy lamp digital models. I found this one on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a> and decided to explore it further to incorporate into my own design:<br><br>

            <img src="a5-left-leaf-closed-mesh.png" width=300></a><br><br>

            My initial vision was to create a warm, decorative lamp design that could hang from a corner near the wall using ceiling hooks and cord hooks to suspend it. At first I thought I might hang the lamp shade facing downward from the lamp socket.  Based on the approximate measurements of my lamp socket (28 mm in diameter, 56 mm in length) and the length of the cord (12 feet!), this design seemed feasible using the leafy lamp shade. I did some quick sketches to visualize it:<br><br>
            <img src="a5-sketches-downward-leaves.png" width=300></a><br><br>
          
            Next, I went to the university makerspace to prepare my project for printing so that I could test the initial design.  Since I wanted to create a warm ambiance from the light, I decided to use an orange PLA filament for 3D printing. On one of the Dremel printers, I placed all 3 leaves standing pointing upwards in a single STL file. Each leaf had a hole at its base with a diameter slightly smaller than the diameter of the lamp socket. The estimated printing time was 8 hours, and I added supports to my leaves so that they would print without falling over.<br><br>
            <img src="a5-dremel-leaves.jpg" width=300></a><br><br>          
            <img src="a5-leaf-lamp-with-supports.png" width=300></a><br>
            <a href="a5-leaf-lamp-parts.3mf">Rhino file</a><br><br>

            The leaves printed beautifully, so I started building my lamp, theorizing that the base of the 3 leaves would neatly stack on top of each other at a 90 degree angle from the 3 leaves pointing down. I imagined that the weight from stacking the 3 leaf bases would prevent the lamp shade pieces from moving out of place.<br><br> 

            Alas, I was wrong! There wasn't enough structure in place with stacked leaf bases to hold them in place at 90 degrees without needing some kind of additional fastening mechanism. The bases of the leaves did not sit flush at the top of the socket but rather had a loose fit with small gaps.<br><br>

            Therefore, I decided to pivot my lamp design once more, this time leveraging a bedroom lamp for which I had been planning to buy a new lampshade. I removed the old shade, leaving only the lamp stand, innards, and light buld connected and intact. Brown, curvy, and symmetrical in shape, I thought it could make a lovely base to contrast and showcase my new, bright orange, leafy lamp shade. For my next test, I took measurements of the lamp socket on the bedroom lamp stand to check for fit and discovered that the bases of my leaves would fit perfectly around the socket!<br><br>

            I arranged the leaves with the largest one in front, then two slightly smaller leaves on either side of the larger one. It was a perfect fit at the base of the leaves with no gaps in between them and no need for additional fasteners of any kind:<br><br>           
            <img src="a5-no-gaps-leaves.jpg" width=300></a><br><br>

            In the end, the final lamp came together better than I imagined!<br><br>

            PART 2: To kick off my molding and casting project, I started by searching <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a> for inspiration from Italy and landed on this Ferro di prua (iron prow-head of a gondola, the most iconic boat that one can find in Venice). Given that my mother's side of the family all have Venetian roots, this ornament has sentimental value:<br><br>
            <img src="a6-pic-ferro-di-prua.png" width=300></a><br>
            <img src="a6-head-of-gondola.png" width=300></a><br><br>

            To have a physical model of a gondola and iron prow to use for further ideation, I 3D printed these STL files that I found online. I scaled the gondola down by 90% just to have a model that I could hold in one hand for reference, and I scaled down the iron prow as well so that I could get a sense for how I might need to modify the object in order to use it effectively to create a 3D printed mold:<br><br>
            <img src="a6-3d-gondola-and-prow.jpg" width=300></a><br>
            <a href="a6-gondola-body.stl">Gondola body STL file</a><br>
            <a href="a6-gondola-head.stl">Gondola iron prow STL file</a><br><br>

            I thought the unique shape of the iron prow would make an interesting molding and casting challenge. My plan was to keep it on the smaller side but to scale it up large (and wide) enough to mitigate breaking the object when later removing it from a mold in later steps. The iron prow head of the gondola is full of symbolism with each element of its design having historical and regional significance to the people of the Veneto region.<br><br>

            I brought the STL file I found online into Rhino and used it as a departure point to start designing my 3D mold:<br><br>
