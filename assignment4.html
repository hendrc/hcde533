             For this project, my goal was to design a box made up of flat panels with fingerjoints. I 3D printed all of the box panels to design for an interference fit so that when the panels are pressed together, they join tightly and do not need additional fasteners or screws. 
             The challenge was to design a close enough fit that the resulting box could hold something like sugar without leaking.<br><br>   
                
             With direct support from our wonderful teaching assistant, Junchao, I learned how to create this initial box model in Rhino:<br><br>

             While looking around for more inspiration, I noticed this old-fashinoned coffee box with finger joints in the display case of a local coffee shop:<br><br>

             <img src="a4-box-inspiration2.jpg" width=300></a><br><br>

             As a next step, I did some sketching:<br><br>

             Then I looked online for a digital version of a 3D box with similar finger joints that I could try to model in Rhino from scratch. I used this box for inspiration:<br>

             I started to model my own box pieces in Rhino. The pictures below show the progression of my work:<br><br>
