            My object's dimensions measure 57.7 mm on all sides. I added 4 symmetrical notches on each side, and for a snug press-fit, I applied filletcorners. My notches measured 4 mm in width at first, but testing the first 2 laser printed pieces showed that the fit was too loose. I reduced the width of my notches to 3.5 mm and re-ran my test with 2 new pieces, which made a perfect fit!
