            My design shape's dimensions measure 57.7 mm on all sides. I added 4 symmetrical notches on each side, and for a snug press-fit, I applied filletcorners. My notches measured 4 mm in width at first, but testing the first 2 laser printed pieces showed that the fit was too loose. I reduced the width of my notches to 3.5 mm and re-ran my test with 2 new pieces, which made a perfect fit! 
    
            My design journey started with some research. I bought this great book last summer from the <a href="https://www.talkstorybookstore.com/">Talk Story Bookstore</a> on Kauai, Hawaii and took this opportunity to use it for design inspiration!<br>

            Initially, thinking about my press-fit goal for this assignment, this design caught my attention.<br>

            In lieu of sketching, I used playing cards (having somewhat similar geometric shape/dimensions) to explore how the pieces might intersect when piecing them together into a new form. I quickly discovered some downsides about using playing cards (in lieu of paper or cardboard) to simulate press-fitting: the card texture is stiff and difficult to cut, and the smooth, slippery card surface creates less friction, so press fitting into a new, complex form becomes difficult. I abandoned the playing cards after 10 or 15 minutes of ideation.<br>

            Being unfamiliar with computer-assisted design, I watched a tutorial given by our fantastic teaching assistant, Junchao Yang, on how to model objects using Rhino software. Then I prototyped this new shape in digital form.<br>

            I went to the makerspace to laser print my design and do some testing. Before printing, I had to convert my Rhino file to Adobe Illustrator.<br>
