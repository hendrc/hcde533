Who are you? Why do you want to learn about digital fabrication? What do you hope to learn in the class? What do you want to teach your peers?
My name is Courtenay Hendricks, and I'm a part-time student in HCDE. This is my third and final year of the program. 
I'm taking digital fabrication to enjoy a hands-on engineering class in a studio environment, which will be a new experience for me. 
I'm looking forward to the challenge of learning all about 3D printing, laser cutting, modeling, molding, and casting, and working with a variety of new tools and technology.
With regard to teaching my peers, the skills I can offer fall more into project management, and I would be happy to offer consultation in this area.
